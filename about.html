CUSU LGBT+ is the Cambridge University LGBT+ campaign! We're a CUSU (cusu.cam.ac.uk) autonomous campaign run by a students within the university. We run a range of social and educational events, including regular coffee meets, speaker events, pub crawls and more!
This website is to show the differences in colleges' policies regarding LGBT+ issues.
We're currently missing information on Christs', Gonville and Caius, Jesus, Magdalene, Selwyn, St Edmund's, St Johns', Trinity Hall and Wolfson, so please get in touch if you know anything about these colleges!
